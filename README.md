# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone /C:/Users/Manoj reddy/Desktop/otp-authentication
    cd otp-authentication
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Build for production:**
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

5. **Preview the production build:**
    ```sh
    npm run serve
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run serve`: Serves the production build locally.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
